%People have gathered from around the world to witness the 2015 snail races.
%Each snail was handpicked by its country to race its way across 
%the brutal 10cm track. Try to figure out the finishing time, 
%country of origin, and shell color for each of the five snails. 
%Don't be discouraged if it takes a while to solve, 
%this is a snail race after all.

%1. Of Todd and the snail with the teal shell, 
%one finished in 24 minutes and the other is from Mexico.

%2. The snail from Mexico finished 3 minutes after 
%the snail with the lime shell, who finished 1 minute before 
%the snail with the silver shell (who wasn't Hank).

%3. The snail from USA finished 2 minutes before Kipp, 
%who finished some time before the snail from Spain.

%4. Of Ralph and the Spain contestant one had the fastest time and the other had the violet shell.

%5. The snail from Canada was either the one with the teal shell or the one who finished in 25 minutes.
