%Three people met at a corner of a street. 
%They all are dressed like cops, so they 
%don't know who's the thief (bad guy). 
%The cops will tell the truth (because they are good), 
%and the thief will tell the truth too to 
%make himself appear like a good cop. 
%They are A, B and C. And they say this:

%A:"C's not the thief."
%B:"One of you both is the thief!"
%C:"I'm not the thief."

%Using this information, find out who the thief is.

%Answer
%A's the thief. He says C's not the thief, 
%and B says one of the other two is, 
%which means he must not be. So the only one left is A.
